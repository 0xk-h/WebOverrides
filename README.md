# WebOverrides

Small client-side overrides for websites that don’t behave the way they should.

A personal collection of Tampermonkey userscripts I use to reduce friction,
automate repetitive actions, and adjust UI behavior to my workflow.

> Built for daily use. No framework. No overengineering.

More overrides added as needed.
